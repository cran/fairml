Description: Fair machine learning regression models which take sensitive attributes into account in
  model estimation. Currently implementing Komiyama et al. (2018) 
  <http://proceedings.mlr.press/v80/komiyama18a/komiyama18a.pdf> and an improvement over the former
  that uses ridge regression to enforce fairness.
