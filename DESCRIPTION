Description: Fair machine learning regression models which take sensitive attributes into account in
  model estimation. Currently implementing Komiyama et al. (2018) 
  <http://proceedings.mlr.press/v80/komiyama18a/komiyama18a.pdf>, Zafar et al.
  (2019) <https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume20/18-262/18-262.pdf> and my own
  approach that uses ridge regression to enforce fairness.
